# SQL_GET_QUERY_GENERATOR
A nifty little function that aims to help the people that are trying to build complex advanced search or sorting engines.


How to use?

Use the predefined parameters array to declare what $_GET values your form/link is sending


For instance , I have used for criteria the GET value of user_rank and declared the sql field name rank. Same goes for the sort option.

Feel free to ask any questions.

Example usage:

Cheers!
