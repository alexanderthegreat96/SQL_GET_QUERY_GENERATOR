# SQL_GET_QUERY_GENERATOR

I wrote the script to allow myself to build advanced MySQL queries without the need for manual intervantion.
It is built to work with $_GET params, forms , to be more specific. Alloing developers to build search engines, sort mechanisms for both front and back-end websites . 

It is able to work with fixed criteria, as in SELECT from tablename WHERE field='value', REGEXP, BETWEEN values and multiple sorting params. Just follow the example.php file  and structure your array acording to the GET param you are sending.

Cheers!
